# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Project

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project! This project aims to utilize machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health parameters. 🚀

## 🌟 Features
- **Accurate Predictions**: Uses a well-trained model to predict diabetes with high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-use interface for making predictions.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## 📊 Data
The dataset used for this project is the famous [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). It contains medical records for females of Pima Indian heritage and includes various health metrics.

## 🚀 Model
The project employs several machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The final model is selected based on its performance on the validation set.

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📝 Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## 📈 Results
The final model achieves an accuracy of **80%** on the test set, with the following performance metrics:

## 🤖 Future Work
- Enhance the model with more advanced algorithms.
- Implement a web application for real-time diabetes prediction.
- Incorporate additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
